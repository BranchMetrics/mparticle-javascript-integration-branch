# mParticle JS Web Integration for the Branch Web SDK

A web integration (or a kit) is an extension to the core [mParticle Web SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-javascript-sdk). This kit works as a bridge between the mParticle SDK and Branch's SDK.

The kit takes care of initializing, forwarding events, and tracking identities for you.
